Master-Master Replication
	Couchbase, Arrango
	
	

The multi-master replication system is responsible for propagating the data modifications made by each member to the rest of the group, 
and resolving any conflicts that might arise between concurrent changes made by different members. 


	
Advantages

    Accessability: If one master fails, other masters continue to update the database.
    Distributed Access: Masters can be located in several physical sites, i.e. distributed across the network.

Disadvantages

    Consistency: Most multi-master replication systems are only loosely consistent, i.e. lazy and asynchronous, violating ACID properties.
    			 There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
    Performance: Eager replication systems are complex and increase communication latency.
    Integrity: Issues such as conflict resolution can become intractable as the number of nodes involved rises and latency increases.
