Additional benefits include:

    Increased security - Hide information about backend servers, blacklist IPs, limit number of connections per client
    Increased scalability and flexibility - Clients only see the reverse proxy's IP, allowing you to scale servers or change their configuration
    SSL termination - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
        Removes the need to install X.509 certificates on each server
    Compression - Compress server responses
    Caching - Return the response for cached requests
    Static content - Serve static content directly
        HTML/CSS/JS
        Photos
        Videos
        Etc

        
        
Reverse Proxy V/S Load balancers

The basic definitions are simple:

    A reverse proxy accepts a request from a client, forwards it to a server that can fulfill it, and returns the serverâ€™s response to the client.
    A load balancer distributes incoming client requests among a group of servers, in each case returning the response from the selected server to the appropriate client.
