Redis Architecture
	in-memory, key-value data store  (stored data in RAM in form of key-value)
	SINGLE THREADED (Therefore can run  cores/2 instances on same machine)
	Support atomic operation
	Has Pub/Sub functionality
	Master-Slave replication policy by default
	
	
Supported Data types :
	List
	set
	sorted set
	hast table
	many more ....... 
	
Also support CRDT's (Conflict resolution data type)

	
Redis Persistance
	1) Scheduled backups to disk (intermediate data will be lost)
	2) Logging write/update operation (Huge log data)


Redis Replication
	Master-Slave architecture ... on master failure .. promote slave as master (No writes will be accepted till promotion completes) 
	
	
Clustering In Redis
	data can be sharded(divided) into many computers	
		Schedule manual backup of each node (data for which node is acting as master) regularly.
