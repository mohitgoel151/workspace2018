Memcache
	multithreaded event-based key/value cache 
	No persistance (server crash .. data lost)
	No replication 
	Client manages memcache server and data sharding. Each memcache server is independent and unaware of other in cluster
	Utilizes multiple cores (where as Redis utlizies only one)



Data fetching
	Consistent hashing
	You only need to update your application with a list of ipâ€™s where your memcache servers are located so it automatically use all your servers.
