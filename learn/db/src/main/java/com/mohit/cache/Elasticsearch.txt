Elasticsearch
	Lucene based SYSTEM
	stores data in reverse index manner
	

Usages :
 	1) Auto complete (Prefix and suffix tree)
 	2) searching
 	3) A simple search with multiple terms is then done by looking up all the terms and their occurrences, 
 	   and take the intersection (for AND searches) or the union (for OR searches) of the sets of occurrences to get the resulting list of documents
 	4) geo hashes
	

Properties :
	Indexes are built first in-memory, then occasionally flushed in segments to disk.
	Index segments are immutable. Deleted documents are marked as such.
	An index is made up of multiple segments. A search is done on every segment, with the results merged.
	Which Elasticsearch indexes, and what shards (and replicas) search requests are sent to, can be customized in many ways
		1) Lots of data is time based, e.g. logs, tweets, etc. By creating an index per day (or week, month, â€¦), we can efficiently limit searches to 
		    certain time ranges - and expunge old data. Remember, we cannot efficiently delete from an existing index, but deleting an entire index is cheap.
    	2) When searches must be limited to a certain user (e.g. "search your messages"), it can be useful to route all the documents for that user to the same shard, 
    		to reduce the number of indexes that must be searched.
