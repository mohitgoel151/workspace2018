Minimum Spanning Tree :

	1. Kruskal Algo : 
		Add all edges to PQ (increasing order) => ElogE
		keep pop-ing each node and check if both edges are already part of same cluster.  { (log* V) can be assumed as O(1)  (actually its more than that) }  
			if YES
				continue
			else 
				consider that edge and connect those 2 clusters (union)
		Keep on doing this untill we find required number of edges.
		
		Time : ElogE { ElogE for building PQ + ElogE for removal from PQ + Elog*v for union and find)
		Space : O(E)  {while building PQ}
		
		Sample Problem : Water distribution
	
	
	
	2. Prism's Algo
		
		Pick any vertex on random
		Add all adjacent nodes/edges in PQ.
		
		iterate over PQ until its empty
			check if this node is already visited
			if YES
				continue
			else 
				consider this vertex and add all adjacent vertex in PQ
		
		Time : ElogE { ElogE for building PQ + ElogE for removal from PQ)
		Space : O(E)  {worst case : while building PQ}
	
	
Shortest Path Algo :

	1. Dijkstra Algo : (Doesn't work with -ve edges)
		Its approach and implementation is similar to Prism's Algo.
		Here we have a fixed source vertex from which we want to track distance. 
		
		At each step we add edge to PQ and process least weighted edge (if not processed earlier).
		
		Time and space complexities are also same.
		
		
	2. Bellman Ford Algo (no negative cycle)
		Take all vertex in array(in sequence order is fixed) or in map
		Mark distance of starting point as 0 and distance of all other edges as Int.MAX  
		Consider all edges and update weight of nodes if   (source weight + edge weight < target weight)
			Repeat this V-1 times
		After all repetitions we will get our final result.
		
		Time :  O(VE)
		
		
		

Longest Path Algo :
	Make all edges weights -ve and then run Dijkstra algo on that graph.
	
	
All vertex to all vertex paths
	Floyd Warshell Algo :
	
		for hop  0 -> n
			for from 0 -> n
				for to 0 -> n
					w[from][to] = w[from][hop] + w[hop][to]
