Bubble Sort 
	comparing pairs of adjacent elements and then swapping their positions if they exist in the wrong order. 
	
	Time Complexity = O(n*n)
	
	for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) 
		for(int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++)
			if(A[ i ] > A[ i+1] ) => SWAP
	
	
Pros :
	# In place sorting (no extra space required)
	# Stable Sorting
	
Cons :
	#
